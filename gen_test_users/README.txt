The script here generates a version-2 user (a user under the new encryption
scheme) with a single page and a version-1 user (a user under the old encryption
scheme) with four pages. The purpose is to log in each user and test that the
site operates as intended (maybe this could be automated further eventually).

version-2 user credentials:
username | password
---------+---------
 ne_test | testing

version-1 user credentials:
username | password
---------+---------
 oe_test | testing
